# Job Tracker & Autofill - Chrome Extension

Track job applications and autofill forms using Supabase.

## Setup

### 1. Create Supabase Tables

Run `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the required tables.

### 2. Generate Icons

Open `generate-icons.html` in a browser, right-click each canvas, and save as:
- `icons/icon16.png`
- `icons/icon48.png`  
- `icons/icon128.png`

### 3. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `chrome-extension/` folder

### 4. Configure

The extension uses your existing Supabase credentials (already configured in `background.js`).

### 5. Google Login (per-user data)

1. **Enable Google provider** in Supabase:
   `Authentication` → `Providers` → `Google` → enable and add your Google OAuth Client ID/Secret (already done if your admin dashboard logs in with Google).
2. **Add the extension redirect URL** in Supabase:
   `Authentication` → `URL Configuration` → `Redirect URLs` → add `https://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>.chromiumapp.org/`
   (Find your extension ID on `chrome://extensions` after loading the unpacked extension.)
3. **Update the database** (per-user RLS): re-run the updated `supabase-schema.sql` in the Supabase SQL Editor. This adds a `user_id` column and makes each user see only their own rows.
4. Reload the extension in `chrome://extensions` (the reload adds the new `identity` permission).
5. Open the popup and click **Login with Google**.

> Note: Rows tracked before login have no `user_id` and won't appear after logging in.
